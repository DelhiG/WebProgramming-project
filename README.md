To add a city click on the "Add a city" button. A form appear and you now have to select the name of the image you will upload, then the picture and lastly enter a short description.
You can't submit a new picture if you don't fufill the three inputs (name, image, description).
You then have to click on the "Confirm" button to see the image appear with it's tittle and description, you can also press the enter key on your keyboard.

The description can be changed afterward. Note that the description is not really responsive as the description will go over the next row if it is too long and the line will not automatically break mid word if it doesn't fit in the space reserved, instead it will expand the space and the picture associated with it.

Only file with an image format will be acceted to be upload.

To remove a city click on the "Remove a city" button. A form appear and you have to enter the tittle of the city you want to remove from your website.
It is possible to add cities with the same name but with different images, in this case if you want to remove the cities with the same name you will have to remove all the pictures with the same name starting from the bottom-right.

You can make the forms appear and disappear by clicking on the "Add a city" and "Remove a city" buttons.
